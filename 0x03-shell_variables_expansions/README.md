In Week 5 of the Linux module at Pathways Cohort 1, the focus is typically on deepening system administration skills, especially in user management, file permissions, and process control. Participants learn how to create, modify, and manage users and groups, assign proper file ownership and permissions using chmod, chown, and chgrp, and monitor system processes using commands like ps, top, kill, and nice. This week often builds on earlier foundational knowledge and prepares learners to understand how Linux manages resources, users, and system security, setting the stage for more advanced topics like shell scripting and networking in the weeks ahead.
