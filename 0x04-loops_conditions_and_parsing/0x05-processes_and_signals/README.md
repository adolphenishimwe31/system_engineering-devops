In Week 7 of the ALX Linux pathway, the focus is on understanding and managing processes and signals in a Linux environment. A process is any running program, and during this week, learners explore how to view active processes using commands like ps, top, and pgrep. They also learn how to control these processes with tools such as kill, killall, nice, and renice to manage priorities and terminate or adjust processes. The concept of signals is introduced, including common ones like SIGINT and SIGKILL, which are used to interrupt or forcefully stop processes. Learners also gain hands-on experience with job control using commands like bg, fg, and jobs. Additionally, they learn how to write scripts that handle signals safely using trap, and how to print or use their own scriptâ€™s Process ID (PID) using the special variable $$. This week builds essential skills for system administration, automation, and creating more robust Bash scripts.
