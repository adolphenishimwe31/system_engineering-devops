In Week 3 of the ALX Foundations program, the focus was on mastering basic shell scripting and understanding how to interact with the Linux command line. We learned how to navigate directories, list files using different options (such as long format and showing hidden files), change permissions, and write executable shell scripts. This week emphasized the importance of precision, file organization, and executable script structure using shebangs (#!/bin/bash). It also introduced Git and GitHub basics, reinforcing the habit of version control and collaboration. By the end of the week, I gained confidence in writing simple shell scripts and using command-line tools effectively for everyday tasks in software development.
