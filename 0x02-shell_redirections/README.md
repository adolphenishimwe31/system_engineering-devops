In Week 4 of Linux training, the focus is often on mastering file permissions and ownership to control access and security. You learn how to view and modify permissions for files and directories using commands like chmod, chown, and chgrp. This week emphasizes understanding the three permission classes—owner, group, and others—and the types of permissions (read, write, execute). You also practice setting numeric (octal) permissions and symbolic modes, enabling fine control over who can read, modify, or execute files. Additionally, you work with changing ownership of files and directories and explore permission effects on directories versus files. This foundational knowledge is critical for managing multi-user environments securely and efficiently in Linux.
